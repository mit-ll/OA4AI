## Overview
In 2014, the Department of Defense (DoD) introduced the Risk Management Framework (RMF) to help federal agencies better manage risks associated with operating information systems. Insertion of new technologies required to keep pace with advances in Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) solutions have proven difficult within existing RMF approaches. As a result, regulated systems lag in their use  of advanced AI/ML life cycle software and distributed infrastructure due to the perceived downside deployment risks. To address these limitations, MIT Lincoln Laboratory is developing the Open Architecture for Artificial Intelligence (OA4AI) project. The OA4AI project provides a reference architecture enabling the government and commercial industry to bring new capabilities to bear within shorter timeframes, lower costs, and benefits impacting proof-of-concept prototypes and large demonstration systems.
